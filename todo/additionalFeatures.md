## **Core Jira Features You May Be Missing**

### **1. Agile Boards**
- **Scrum Boards**: Manage sprints with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- **Kanban Boards**: Provide a continuous workflow view for tasks.
- **Swimlanes**: Group tasks by user, priority, or custom categories.

---

### **2. Reporting and Analytics**
- **Burndown Charts**: Track sprint progress and estimate task completion rates.
- **Velocity Charts**: Show the team’s work capacity across sprints.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagrams**: Visualize bottlenecks in workflows.
- **Sprint Reports**: Display completed tasks, remaining tasks, and blockers in a sprint.

---

### **3. Advanced Roadmaps**
- Plan and visualize tasks across multiple teams and projects.

---

### **4. Automation**
- Create **if-this-then-that (IFTTT)** rules:
  - E.g., "When a task is moved to 'Done,' notify the task assignee."
  - E.g., "If a task is unassigned for 3 days, auto-assign it to a default user."
- Support custom triggers:
  - Task creation, field updates, or due date changes.

  - Text, dropdowns, dates, checkboxes, or numeric fields.

---

### **10. Backlog Management**
- Dedicated **backlog view** for tasks that aren’t in the current sprint.
- Drag-and-drop prioritization of backlog tasks.

  - Role-based access (e.g., Admins, Developers, Viewers).
- Support for private projects and restricted tasks.

---

### **12. Integration Support**
- Connect with tools like:
  - **GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket**: Link commits, branches, and pull requests to tasks.
  - **Slack or Teams**: Send task updates directly to communication channels.
  - **Confluence**: Link documents and wiki pages to tasks or projects.

---

### **13. Templates**
- Predefined templates for common workflows:
  - Software development, bug tracking, content creation, and IT support.
- Customizable templates for unique team needs.

---

### **14. User Story Mapping**
- Map out user journeys:
  - Show steps users take to accomplish goals.
  - Connect tasks to each step of the journey.

---

### **15. Dependency and Blocker Management**
- Visualize task dependencies (e.g., Task A must be completed before Task B starts).
- Mark tasks as blocked and track unblocking progress.

---

### **16. Mobile App**
- Support for a mobile-first experience:
  - View and update tasks on the go.
  - Push notifications for urgent updates.
